# Map Nectar
## Pseudo 3d Hexmap building tool

Map Nectar is a map building tool build on React and PIXI.js to create 3-dimensional hexagon
based maps in a 2-dimensional environment. The map concept is inspired by the isometric maps 
from Final Fantasy Tactics, but using hexagonal tiles instead of square tiles.

To load a set of textures into the map, click the Tile Sets option, and load the corresponding .png image with the `Load Image` button, followed by the corresponding JSON texture atlas with the `Load Atlas` button. Example textures can be found in the `./res` directory of this repository.

A sample map can be imported with the file downloaded from [./res/sample-map-export.json](./res/sample-map-export.json).

Included map assets found in `./res` are created
